## <u>Code snippets</u>

```Python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import ruptures as rpt
import numpy as np


signal: np.array = ...

# detection
algo = rpt.Pelt(model="rbf").fit(signal)
predicted_breakpoints = algo.predict(pen=10)

#display
rpt.display(signal, predicted_breakpoints)
plt.show()

```

## <u>Other notes and questions</u>
 
- Ruptures to detect change points from non-stationary signals such as trend, seasonality, and variance.
- With change points, you can detect anomalies or deviations from the expected behavior and gain insights into when these transitions occur.
